# Music Genre Classification with XGBoost, RandomForest, and Decision Tree

This project is a music genre classification system that uses three different machine learning algorithms: XGBoost, RandomForest, and Decision Tree. It allows you to predict the genre of a song based on its audio features, such as tempo, pitch, and loudness.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploring the code and visualizations)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-genre-classification.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   bash
   cd music-genre-classification
   
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle: [GTZAN Music Genre Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).

4. Preprocess the data: Depending on your dataset format, you may need to preprocess it to extract relevant audio features like tempo, pitch, loudness, etc.

5. Train the models: Use Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train the XGBoost, RandomForest, and Decision Tree models using your preprocessed dataset.

6. Evaluate the models: Calculate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model to assess their performance.

## Usage

1. To make genre predictions, you can use the trained models to classify the genre of a song based on its audio features.

2. You can also use the provided Jupyter Notebook to see examples of how to use the models for prediction.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created to explore music genre classification using machine learning algorithms. You can acknowledge the [GTZAN Music Genre Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) on Kaggle for providing the dataset used in this project.
